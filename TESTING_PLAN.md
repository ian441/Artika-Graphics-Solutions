# Testing Plan for Frontend and Backend

## Backend API Testing
- [x] Health check endpoint: GET /api/health
- [ ] Admin dashboard endpoint: GET /api/admin/dashboard
- [ ] User authentication endpoints
- [ ] Portfolio management endpoints
- [ ] Contact form endpoints

## Frontend Testing
- [ ] Client dashboard responsiveness
- [ ] Admin dashboard responsiveness
- [ ] Navigation functionality
- [ ] Form submissions
- [ ] API integration

## Issues Found
- Admin dashboard API failing due to missing PortfolioController.getProjectCount method
- Server not restarting to pick up code changes
