# Backend Integration - TODO List

## âœ… Completed Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Setup & Configuration
- [x] Created backend API structure with Express.js
- [x] Set up MongoDB database connection
- [x] Created Contact and Portfolio models
- [x] Implemented contact and portfolio controllers
- [x] Set up API routes for contact and portfolio
- [x] Created server.js with proper middleware setup

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
- [x] Created API service layer with error handling
- [x] Created configuration file with API base URL and constants
- [x] Updated Contact component to use backend API
- [x] Updated Portfolio component to fetch data from backend
- [x] Added loading states and error handling
- [x] Implemented character counters and validation

### Phase 3: Environment Setup
- [x] Created .env.example file for environment variables
- [x] Updated package.json scripts for both frontend and backend

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Test contact form submission functionality
- [ ] Test portfolio data fetching
- [ ] Set up MongoDB database with sample data
- [ ] Test API endpoints with Postman or similar tool
- [ ] Create sample portfolio data in database
- [ ] Test frontend-backend integration
- [ ] Set up environment variables for production
- [ ] Deploy backend to hosting service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy frontend to hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

### Phase 5: Additional Features (Optional)
- [ ] Add image upload functionality for portfolio
- [ ] Implement authentication for admin panel
- [ ] Add portfolio project management interface
- [ ] Implement contact form email notifications
- [ ] Add portfolio project filtering and search
- [ ] Implement pagination for portfolio projects

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

The backend integration is complete! The frontend components (Contact and Portfolio) are now connected to the backend API. The application can:
- Submit contact forms to the backend database
- Fetch portfolio projects from the backend
- Handle loading states and errors gracefully
- Validate form inputs with character counters

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev

# Start frontend development server  
cd client && npm install && npm start

# Install dependencies for both
npm run install-all
```

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Needed

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The application is ready for testing and deployment!
