# Color Tone Update Plan

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated `client/tailwind.config.js` with new color palettes:
  - Blue: Reflective slate blues (deeper, moody)
  - Gray: Warmer, earthy stone grays
  - Purple: Muted purples for accents
  - Red: Muted reds for chaos
  - Black: Dark slate
  - White: Warm white
- [x] Updated inline CSS in `client/src/components/About.jsx`:
  - Changed milestone dot background to new blue-500 (#0284C7)
  - Changed timeline line to new gray-400 (#CBD5E0)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run the client application to verify the new color tone
- [ ] Check all components for visual consistency
- [ ] Adjust any specific colors if needed for better "reflective, layered, raw, chaotic beautifully human" feel
- [ ] Test responsiveness and accessibility of new colors
